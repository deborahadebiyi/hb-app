In a scenario where you have a business model with a rating property and a customer model, and customers can leave ratings for businesses, you need to decide how you want to store and update the ratings.

Options for Storing Ratings:
Store an Aggregated Rating in the Business Model:

The rating property in the business model is updated based on the average of all ratings left by customers.
You keep the average rating and update it incrementally whenever a new rating is added.
Store Individual Ratings in a Separate Collection:

Store each rating separately (e.g., in a BusinessRating collection), and then calculate the average rating when needed or update the business's rating property based on this collection.
Option 1: Updating the Average Rating in the Business Model
If you want to maintain an average rating directly in the Business schema, you can update the average incrementally whenever a customer leaves a new rating.

Business Schema (Business.ts):
typescript
Copy code
import mongoose, { Schema, Document } from 'mongoose';

interface IBusiness extends Document {
  name: string;
  rating: number; // Average rating
  ratingCount: number; // Total number of ratings received
}

const BusinessSchema = new Schema<IBusiness>({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  ratingCount: { type: Number, default: 0 },
});

export const Business = mongoose.model<IBusiness>('Business', BusinessSchema);
Customer Leaves a Rating (Incremental Average Update):
When a customer leaves a rating, update the rating and ratingCount properties in the business model.

typescript
Copy code
import { Business } from './Business';

async function leaveRating(businessId: string, newRating: number) {
  const business = await Business.findById(businessId);

  if (!business) {
    throw new Error('Business not found');
  }

  const { rating, ratingCount } = business;
  const updatedRatingCount = ratingCount + 1;
  const updatedRating = (rating * ratingCount + newRating) / updatedRatingCount;

  business.rating = updatedRating;
  business.ratingCount = updatedRatingCount;

  await business.save();
}
Explanation:
This function fetches the business by its ID.
It calculates the new average rating using the formula:
updatedRating
=
(
currentRating
×
ratingCount
)
+
newRating
updatedRatingCount
updatedRating= 
updatedRatingCount
(currentRating×ratingCount)+newRating
​
 
It then updates the rating and ratingCount properties in the database.
Pros:

Efficient as the average is updated incrementally.
Easy to query since the average rating is stored directly in the business document.
Cons:

If a customer updates their rating, handling it can be more complex (you’d need to subtract the old rating first).
Not suitable if you need to keep a history of ratings.
Option 2: Storing Individual Ratings in a Separate Collection
In this approach, each rating is stored as a separate document in a BusinessRating collection. The average rating can be updated periodically or calculated when needed.

BusinessRating Schema (BusinessRating.ts):
typescript
Copy code
import mongoose, { Schema, Document } from 'mongoose';

interface IBusinessRating extends Document {
  businessId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  customerId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  rating: number;
  comment?: string;
}

const BusinessRatingSchema = new Schema<IBusinessRating>({
  businessId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Business', required: true },
  customerId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Customer', required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true, min: 1, max: 5 },
  comment: { type: String },
});

export const BusinessRating = mongoose.model<IBusinessRating>('BusinessRating', BusinessRatingSchema);
Calculating and Updating the Average Rating:
typescript
Copy code
import { Business } from './Business';
import { BusinessRating } from './BusinessRating';

async function leaveRating(businessId: string, customerId: string, rating: number, comment?: string) {
  // Save the individual rating
  await BusinessRating.create({
    businessId,
    customerId,
    rating,
    comment,
  });

  // Calculate the new average rating
  const ratings = await BusinessRating.find({ businessId });
  const totalRatings = ratings.length;
  const sumOfRatings = ratings.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.rating, 0);
  const averageRating = sumOfRatings / totalRatings;

  // Update the business with the new average rating
  await Business.findByIdAndUpdate(businessId, {
    rating: averageRating,
    ratingCount: totalRatings,
  });
}
Explanation:
Each rating is stored as a separate document in the BusinessRating collection.
When a new rating is added, the average is recalculated based on all ratings for that business.
The Business model is then updated with the new average rating.
Pros:

Keeps a full history of ratings, which can be useful for analytics or showing individual reviews.
Easier to handle updates (e.g., if a customer wants to change their rating).
More flexible and scalable for additional features (e.g., reviews, comments).
Cons:

Requires additional queries to calculate the average rating.
Potentially less efficient for frequently updated ratings.
Which Approach to Choose?
If your primary concern is performance and you only need the average rating, use Option 1 (updating the average directly).
If you need to keep a history of ratings (e.g., for displaying reviews or analytics), use Option 2 (separate ratings collection).
Handling Edge Cases:
Duplicate Ratings: If a customer can only leave one rating per business, ensure uniqueness using a combination of businessId and customerId in the BusinessRating schema.
Rating Updates: If a customer updates their rating, find the existing rating document, update it, and then recalculate the average rating.
Concurrent Updates: Use atomic operations or transactions if multiple customers are rating the business at the same time.
This should give you a robust solution for handling customer ratings and updating the business model accordingly. Let me know if you need more details or customization!
