If you want to query a property specific to the Customer model using the accountId, hereâ€™s how you can approach it:

Scenario Overview
Base Model (User): Holds common fields like accountId, username, email, etc.
Customer Model: Extends the User model with additional fields like purchaseHistory or preferences.
Vendor Model: Extends the User model with fields like products or businessName.
Since both Customer and Vendor are stored in the User collection (with a role field differentiating them), you need to:

Query the User collection.
Filter by role to ensure you're targeting a Customer.
Retrieve the property you need.
Example Query
Querying for a Specific Customer Property by accountId
Assume the Customer model has a field loyaltyPoints. To query this field for a specific Customer:

typescript
Copy code
import UserModel from "./models/user"; // Base User model

async function getCustomerPropertyByAccountId(accountId: string) {
  const customer = await UserModel.findOne({
    accountId, // Match the accountId
    role: "customer", // Ensure we're querying a Customer
  }).select("loyaltyPoints accountId username");

  if (!customer) {
    throw new Error(`Customer with accountId ${accountId} not found`);
  }

  console.log(`Loyalty Points for ${customer.username}:`, customer.loyaltyPoints);
  return customer.loyaltyPoints;
}

// Example usage
getCustomerPropertyByAccountId("cust12345").catch(console.error);
Query Explanation
Filter:
{ accountId, role: "customer" }: Ensures you're querying for a Customer and not a Vendor.
select():
Fetches only specific fields (loyaltyPoints, accountId, and username) to optimize the query.
Error Handling:
Throws an error if no matching document is found.
Alternative: Populate and Join Queries
If Customer properties reference other collections (e.g., orders in a separate collection):

typescript
Copy code
async function getCustomerOrdersByAccountId(accountId: string) {
  const customer = await UserModel.findOne({
    accountId,
    role: "customer",
  })
    .populate({
      path: "orders", // Assuming `orders` is a field in the Customer schema
      select: "orderNumber totalAmount",
    })
    .exec();

  if (!customer) {
    throw new Error(`Customer with accountId ${accountId} not found`);
  }

  console.log(`Orders for ${customer.username}:`, customer.orders);
  return customer.orders;
}
Optimizing Query Design
Indexes: Add indexes to accountId and role for faster lookups:

typescript
Copy code
UserSchema.index({ accountId: 1, role: 1 });
Discriminator Key: If using Mongoose discriminators for Vendor and Customer, the role field is automatically managed, and queries can directly reference the discriminator model:

typescript
Copy code
const CustomerModel = UserModel.discriminator("Customer", CustomerSchema);

const customer = await CustomerModel.findOne({ accountId }).select("loyaltyPoints");
